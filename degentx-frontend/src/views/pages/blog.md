### 0xJPEGs

* March 12, 2023

Since the launch of 0xBitcoin in Feb 2018, its decentralized community has built open-source software ranging from GPU miners, token mining pools, fan websites, pixel canvases to draw on, and lots of memes (shout-out to Trav).   The 0xJPEGs project is a spiritual successor to '0xBitcoin Memes' and is tribute to all of the 0xBTC community.

This initial set of 60 memes will be auctioned off via custom smart contract using a burn-based reverse dutch auction.  These auctions will exclusively use the credibly-neutral ERC20 currency '0xbitcoin'.  The NFT smart contract will be deployed by the 0xBitcoin deployer account to show official provenance.
